

This is a project for my label Sello Fantasma, a new label that publishes music by Spanish bands. 
This is the first website I created (though not the first one I published). 
For this project, I worked with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Node.js and I opened a repository with Git for the first time.
I learned all of this on my own, with the help of tutorials by Telmo on his website https://telmoacademy.com/, which were incredibly helpful.
